# Uber Earnings & Trip Pattern Analysis

A deep dive into my Uber driving history to uncover earnings trends, peak hours, tip behavior, and optimal driving strategies using Python, pandas, and data visualization.

I worked as an Uber driver in Chicago between January 2023 and September 2024, during which I completed approximately 4300 passenger rides.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository to your computer. On a macOS computer, I would do this by opening a terminal, changing directory into my code folder, and doing `git clone https://github.com/nrrb/uber-analytics-project.git`.
2. Install a Python virtual environment and install the requirements. From the CLI, I would do this by first changing directory into the newly cloned repository, followed by `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
3. Launch Jupyter notebook and open the notebooks. I start Jupyter from the CLI by simply entering `jupyter notebook` and navigating from the Jupyter web interface that automatically opens in my browser.

If you have "batteries included" Python distribution like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) then there should be tools available there for importing and opening a project from a Github repository.
